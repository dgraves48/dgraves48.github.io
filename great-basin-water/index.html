    <h1>What does a changing climate mean for our groundwater?</h1>
    <h2>Simulations from a groundwater flow model of the Southern Great Basin</h2>

            levels are declining</a> across much of the world and the United States. Whether it’s for agriculture,
        industry, or residential areas, <a
            href="https://ourworldindata.org/water-use-stress#:~:text=A%20growing%20global%20population%20and,is%20shown%20in%20the%20chart.">humans
            are using more fresh water</a>, which often comes from groundwater sources.
        This depletes the supply that has built up over thousands of years.
    </p>
    <p>But what about a changing climate? What does that mean for our groundwater supplies? Let’s take a look at this
        through simulations from a groundwater model of the Southern Great Basin.</p>
    <p>The Southern Great Basin covers parts of southern Nevada and southern California and is one of the hottest and
        driest places in the United States.</p>
    <img src="images/climate_web.png">
    <p>Additionally, it has become both hotter and drier since the late 20th century. </p>
    <img src="images/climate_change.png">
    <p>However, in the deeper past, the climate in the region has been much different, both much colder and much wetter.
    </p>
    <p>To understand what these variable past and future climates mean for groundwater in the region, I built a
        groundwater model.</p>
    <img src="images/basin_web.png">
    <p>The model works by adding water through precipitation, removing water through evaporation, and moving water along
        the water table gradient. Under different climates (varying precipitation and temperature), evaporation and
        infiltration vary, and the lake size adjusts until water inputs and outputs balance. In each climate, I
        determine the amount of groundwater recharge by how fast water is cycling through the system. So, let’s get some
        intuition for how the rate of recharge varies under different climates. </p>
    <img src="images/turnover_web.png">
    <p>In wet climates, recharge is much faster than in dry climates: more precipitation means more water flowing
        through the system. Also, in cold climates, recharge is faster than in hot climates: less evaporation means more
        water infiltrates into the system. However, temperature variability is less significant than precipitation
        variability.</p>
    <p>One note here is that the values for turnover time from the model are inaccurate because of model uncertainty,
        but the relative values are good.</p>
    <p>Now that we understand how climate influences groundwater over long time scales, what do we know about short term
        variability? Let’s see how long basins take to respond after the climate shifts. In particular, what features of
        a basin cause longer or shorter responses?</p>
    <img class='bigimg' src="images/simulations_web.png">
    <p>For these simulations, I introduced one of six climate forcings (wetter; drier; colder and wetter; colder and
        drier; hotter and wetter; hotter and drier). I then calculated how long basins of varying width and slope took
        to reach half of the expected lake change. Since lake area determines the balance of water inputs and outputs,
        it is a good measure for basin sensitivity.</p>
    <p>In both bigger and steeper basins, response to climate forcings was slower. In big basins, it takes longer for
        water to flow through the system, so climate changes have a longer lag time. In steep basins, lake volume has to
        change much more than in shallow basins, so it takes longer to fill or empty the lake.</p>
    <p>Where do we go from here? As we know, groundwater pumping can significantly influence groundwater resources.
        Climate can too, changing recharge rate by orders of magnitude. As groundwater management becomes a bigger and
        bigger challenge, local and regional governments should incorporate climate projections into their decision
        making. Also, given the response variation across different types of basins, regulators should consider how
        quickly their particular locations might adjust to climate variability.</p>
